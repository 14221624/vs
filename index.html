  <h3>“Let a thousand flowers bloom” was the guiding theme when the school was inaugurated on 12th June 2006. The school has brought the much awaited CBSE curriculum to the Northern section of the city of Mumbai. While the need was always there, the requirement was for a school that understood education as a tool for character and nation-building along with an academic pursuit.

    The vision of founder Chairman, Dr. Augustine Francis Pinto emphasizes the cultivation of all round development.</h3>
    <h3>
      Life at Ryan is about giving your child the best you have wanted as a parent. From a strong academic foundation to the development of your child's physical, spiritual and emotional personality, the Ryan way is about holistic development in its true sense.
      
      The Ryan way is defined as KASSM - Knowledge, Attitude, Skills, Social & Moral Values. Values with sound knowledge and the wisdom to use it constructively is what provides the differential factor to our students at Ryan. Ryanites are "Kings and Queens in the Making".
      
      Our 40 years of academic excellence is an open testimonial one can refer to.

This is done with an objective to support the new academic paradigm that provides learning for students in a manner most suited to them.
